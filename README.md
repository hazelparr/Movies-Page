# Movies-Page
Project 3 of Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree

<b>Create a Movies Website</b><br>
<i>You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 
You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.</i>

This was my submission to the project brief as described above. Instead of featuring my favorite movies, the movie list includes the
worldwide top grossing films of all time.

Run entertainment_center.py to generate the movie web page.
